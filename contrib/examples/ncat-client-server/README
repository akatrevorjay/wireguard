                === IMPORTANT NOTE ===

Do not use these scripts in production. They are simply a
demonstration of how easy the `wg(8)` tool is at the command
line, but by no means should you actually attempt to use
these. They are horribly insecure and defeat the purpose
of WireGuard.

                     STAY AWAY!

Distros: do not distribute these with your packages.



That all said, this is a pretty cool example of just how
darn easy WireGuard can be.
